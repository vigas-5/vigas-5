   	<p id="ni">Amazing place with huge mountains continueing for thousands of kilometer, and 2000 m from the sea level makes sustainable chill climate and awesome climates in summer and greeninsh plantes wherever u see.<br>
    Natural inhabitants of this queen of mountains is <em>Badugas</em> 'tribes' they mostly don't come down from the mountains, because everything needed is available in the mountains, so they are rarely seen. <strong>But</strong> this beatufil mountain finally discovered by a british mayer when there is need to reach <strong>Mysore</strong> within 2 days, a person recomended that when u cross this nilgries mountains u can reach mysore. During the journey only he discovered that <em> there is a country like ours out at this mountain.</em><br>
